# Multi-Agent-System-for-Dermatology-Practice
* In this project I explored how Multi-Agent Systems for Healthcare (MASH) will unlock the value of AI in hospitals.
* I made a small demo of what a MASH could look like in practice. 
* The demo can be seen in my video presentation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnGlLZbvO9w

* The code is available in MASHvoice.py
* To run the script, you first need to export an Open AI API-key into environment.
* Requirements: pip install --upgrade streamlit openai transformers pillow requests torch accelerate
